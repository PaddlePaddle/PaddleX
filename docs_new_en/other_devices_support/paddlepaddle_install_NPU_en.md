# Ascend NPU PaddlePaddle Installation Tutorial

Currently, PaddleX supports the Ascend 910B chip (more models are under support. If you have a related need for other models, please submit an issue to inform us). The Ascend driver version is 23.0.3. Considering the differences in environments, we recommend using the **Ascend development image provided by PaddlePaddle** to complete the environment preparation.

## 1. Docker Environment Preparation
* Pull the image. This image is only for the development environment and does not contain a pre-compiled PaddlePaddle installation package. The image has CANN-8.0.T13, the Ascend operator library, installed by default.
```bash
# For X86 architecture
docker pull registry.baidubce.com/device/paddle-npu:cann80T13-ubuntu20-x86_64-gcc84-py39
# For Aarch64 architecture
docker pull registry.baidubce.com/device/paddle-npu:cann80T13-ubuntu20-aarch64-gcc84-py39
```
* Start the container with the following command. ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES specifies the visible NPU card numbers.
```bash
docker run -it --name paddle-npu-dev -v $(pwd):/work \
    --privileged --network=host --shm-size=128G -w=/work \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver:/usr/local/Ascend/driver \
    -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
    -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
    -e ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" \
    registry.baidubce.com/device/paddle-npu:cann80T13-ubuntu20-$(uname -m)-gcc84-py39 /bin/bash
```
## 2. Install Paddle Package
Currently, Python 3.9 wheel installation packages are provided. If you have a need for other Python versions, you can refer to the [PaddlePaddle official documentation](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick) to compile and install them yourself.

* Download and install the Python 3.9 wheel installation package
```bash
# Note: You need to install the CPU version of PaddlePaddle first
python3.9 -m pip install paddlepaddle==3.0.0.dev20240520 -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/nightly/cpu/
python3.9 -m pip install paddle_custom_npu==3.0.0.dev20240719 -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/nightly/npu/
```
* After verifying that the installation package is installed, run the following command
```bash
python -c "import paddle; paddle.utils.run_check()"
```
The expected output is as follows

```
Running verify PaddlePaddle program ...
PaddlePaddle works well on 1 npu.
PaddlePaddle works well on 8 npus.
PaddlePaddle is installed successfully! Let's start deep learning with PaddlePaddle now.
